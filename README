Code to generate surprisal values at words in an input sentence.

The model is essentially an implementation of Stolcke (1995), and inspired by Hale (2001).
The idea is to use a stochastic Earley parser built for CFGs, and to compute prefix probabilities at each point in a sentence.
That is, given a sentence w_1,w_2,w_3...w_n, we compute prefix probabilities at each point, i.e. P(w_1), P(w_1,w_2),... P(w_1,w_2,...,w_n)
Then, the surprisal at each word is given by the log of the ratio of the prefix probability till the previous word and the prefix probability till the current word.
That is, surprisal(w_i) = log(P(w_1,...,w_(i-1)) / P(w_1,...,w_i))
